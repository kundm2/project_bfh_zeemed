# Recapitulating Exercise Webapps

## Task
The students will work in groups of two people. If the class contains an odd number of students, one person will work alone.
We want to link all the pieces of code seen until now. You will have to expand a program to manage the patient records in a web interface. 

### Program
Download the following zip file [subjectHomework.zip](http://benoist.ch/WebApps/examples/subjectHomework.zip). It contains a minimal application that we programmed in exercises (it is indeed the solution of our last exercise). It uses the following database [medizininformatik.sql](http://benoist.ch/WebApps/exercises/homework/medizininformatik.sql).

### TO DO
You have to realy improve the program in the direction you want.

Minimal requirements:
- Better layout for the pages (the patient page is particularly ugly),
- Insert a new vital sign for a patient,
- Add list of medicines for a patient,
- Possibility to include new medicines (medicament, quantity taken, who did order, who gave the medicament, ...).
It is particularly important to improve the usablity of the page. 
Maximal: the sky is the limit! I'd like to be astonished!

Ideas:
- Include a graph representing each of the vital signs (temperature, puls,...)
- Insert new patients, and or new staff members.
- Use json or Ajax for communicating with the server.
- ...

### Conditions
This work must be done using PHP, the connection with the data base must use PDO's prepared statements (take care of SQL-injection).
You have to deliver a small report (max 5 pages), insisting on the architecture of the application and what you did. You will send me the report and the source code of your project per mail.
In order to test the project, you will install the project on a test web site provided to you. You will receive for each group credentials for a database and a ftp server, where you will put your program.

## Configuration
